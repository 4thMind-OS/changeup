# ChangeUp  
  
## Dev Environment  
  
### Projects  
  
* VendorLibs  
* ComponentLib  
* (How we break apart the code at dev time)  
* PrimaryFeatureViews  
    * Objectives & Tasks  
    * Rewards  
        * Map out rewards for major objectives, and how that should be broken out for each day’s activities  
            * example:  “Get an A in Physics”  
                * How many days?  
                * What’s the reward?  
                * Each day you can potentially earn whatever equivalent percentage of of the reward...provided you do the task that day AND  
    * Weekly Planner  
        * This is where you plan out your “3 things” for each day.   3 No more.  No Less.  
    * Daily Manager  
        * This is where the “Change” for the day goes.  
            (“Buck the trend”)  
  
            * - 3 Quarters  
                - 2 Dimes  
                - 1 Nickel  
  
### Dev Tools we’ll use  
  
And libs/utils we’ll adopt  
  
* Lerna  
* Mgit  
* Prettier  
* Jest (testing)  
* React  
* Typescript  
* …  
  
### UI Design
