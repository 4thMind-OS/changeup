### Things for Alex to take on
- [ ] look into https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/spa

Things to consider 
- we need Auth to include the following Roles
    - User (general)
    - Account Manager
    - Admin
    - SysAdmin
- We'll want at least 2 apps
    - A mobile app for 
        - Users to look at and take action on their day's ChangeUp challenges/tasks.  (They may also be able to see a week view eventually, but the single day view comes first.)
        - Users and Account Owners to capture quick summary of challenges/tasks for the future ("inbox" style).
    - A web app for 
        - Account owners (people who manage tasks for one or more Users) to enter and organize/manage a Users challenges/tasks over time.
        - More detailed table and chart views
